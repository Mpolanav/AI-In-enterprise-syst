# The program defines three functions: calculate_annual_salary, calculate_monthly_salary, and calculate_bi_weekly_salary. Each function takes the employee's salary as input and calculates the corresponding type of salary based on the function's name. The main function is defined and it asks the user to enter the company name, employee name, and annual salary. After, the program prints the company name and employee name. Then, the program asks the user to choose the type of salary calculation (Annual, Monthly, Bi-Weekly) by taking input from the user.  Based on the user's input, the program calls the appropriate function to calculate the corresponding type of salary. If the user enters an invalid input, the program displays a message stating "Invalid input."
